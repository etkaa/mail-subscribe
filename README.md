# mail-subscribe

This project has been built by using Node.js and Express.js in the back-end, 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap in the front-end. 

User information gets processed in the back-end and then being sent to Mailchimp
servers with HTTP request. 

Great project to learn how to work with external APIs.
